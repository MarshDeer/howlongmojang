			<p>
				Since Mojang said they were going to <a href="https://youtu.be/or1DfXdqu3U?t=1210">add Fireflies to Minecraft</a> during Minecraft Live 2021.<br>
				On May 11, 2022, they confirmed that fireflies <a href="https://youtu.be/ixSlQXDOvkM?t=96">were no longer in their plans</a> during an "Ask Mojang" video.
			</p>
			<p>
			This decision is explained because <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/qa76zm/frogs_shouldnt_eat_fireflies_fireflies_are_toxic/">a single firefly's Lucibufagin is enough to poison and kill</a> pet amphibians or reptiles.<br>
				They have <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/mgmk53/minecraft-parrots-patch">done similar changes</a> in the past with parrots and cookies, to (understandably) stop kids from accidentally poisoning their pets (<a href="https://twitter.com/MiaLem_n/status/847371388641923072">parrots were actually tamed with cookies in 1.12 snapshots!</a>)<br>
			<p>
			Considering the amount of ambiance fireflies would add to the game, and that they <a href="https://youtu.be/or1DfXdqu3U?t=1220">seemed like a mostly finalized feature</a> during Minecraft Live 2021, this decision struck the community as odd.<br>
				There is no reason frogs have to eat fireflies, or why a frog with no other food sources couldn't have a small chance to eat one and be poisoned to illustrate this point, like they did with parrots.

				On October 3, 2020, Mojang <a href="https://youtu.be/DBvZ2Iqmm3M&t=2166">announced the Archaeology System</a> during Minecraft Live 2020.
				On April 14, 2021, they announced that the feature had been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YgKUZnUyak&t=286s">postponed for Caves and Cliffs Part 2</a> during an announcement video</a>.<br>
				On November 17, 2021, they announced that Archaeology had been <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/caves---cliffs-update-part-ii-coming">"put in the backburner"</a>.
				Archaeology was not added to the game in the Wild Update.
			</p>
			<p>
			On February 10, 2023, Mojang announced that <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/archeology-coming-minecraft-120">archaeology would be coming to Minecraft 1.20</a>.<br>
				An archaeology system was added to the game in <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-23w07a">Java Snapshot 23w07a</a>, bringing this system to the game after two years in the backburner.<br>
			</p>
			<p>
				However, the archaeology system added to the game lacks many of the features <a href="https://youtu.be/DBvZ2Iqmm3M&t=2166">shown during its announcement</a>, such as dirt blocks changing size as they are brushed, overworld interactions to decorate clay pots, pots with 8 slots for decorative sherds, baking pots on top of a fire, and a more detailed clay pot model.<br>
				One has to wonder why Mojang stripped the archaeology system from most of its advertised features for release, as one would expect this system to be more developed and polished than its prerelease footage after over two years.
