				"This decision is explained because <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/qa76zm/frogs_shouldnt_eat_fireflies_fireflies_are_toxic/'>a single firefly's Lucibufagin is enough to poison and kill</a> pet amphibians or reptiles.<br>
				They have <a href='https://www.vice.com/en/article/mgmk53/minecraft-parrots-patch'>done similar changes</a> in the past with parrots and cookies, to (understandably) stop kids from accidentally poisoning their pets (<a href='https://twitter.com/MiaLem_n/status/847371388641923072'>parrots were actually tamed with cookies in 1.12 snapshots!</a>)<br>",
				"Considering the amount of ambiance fireflies would add to the game, and that they <a href='https://youtu.be/or1DfXdqu3U?t=1220'>seemed like a mostly finalized feature</a> during Minecraft Live 2021, this decision struck the community as odd.<br>
				There is no reason frogs have to eat fireflies, or why a frog with no other food sources couldn't have a small chance to eat one and be poisoned to illustrate this point, like they did with parrots."
